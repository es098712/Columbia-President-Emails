Having four presidents in three years was not on my bingo card when I entered college. For me and my fellow juniors, we’ve seen Columbia go through more presidents than we’ve had years on campus: first Lee Bollinger, then Minouche Shafik, followed by Katrina Armstrong, and now acting president Claire Shipman. While the 2024-2025 academic year has been calmer than the previous one, the constant turnover reflects a deeper issue: a lack of institutional clarity that has repeatedly thrust Columbia into the national spotlight.

As Columbia begins yet another presidential search, it’s important to reflect on the legacies of our two most recent leaders. I confess that I feel somewhat sorry for how suddenly their tenures concluded (though not too sorry, considering they still received their multi–million dollar paychecks). However, there’s a reason why they were semi-forced to step down: lack of direction/ decisiveness. 

One look at Shafik and Armstrong's emails regarding campus protests speaks volumes. Their inability to communicate their administration's focus clearly and concisely is one reason why, in my opinion, they were unable to withstand the pressure from students, faculty, donors, and the Trump administration. If Shafik and Armstrong couldn’t even craft a straightforward and transparent message to the Columbia community, how could we expect them to lead through moments of intense national scrutiny?

Take this paragraph from Armstrong’s email, “Standing Together for Columbia”:

Our University is defined by the principles of academic freedom, open inquiry, and respect for all. These principles are fundamental to Columbia’s broader mandate of advancing the betterment of our community, our city, our country, and the world. We will defend these principles with courage and determination. It is because of these values that Columbia serves the world so well. From Alexander Hamilton to Dwight D. Eisenhower to the present, we teach, we heal, we innovate, and we create knowledge. To damage Columbia is to weaken American ingenuity and leadership.

That paragraph could have been simplified to: 

Columbia stands for academic freedom, open inquiry, and respect for all, core values that fuel innovation, leadership, and the public good. 

With paragraphs this dense, I’d be surprised if even 20 percent of the student body read any of these emails. Sundial has already critiqued the administration’s poor communication strategies, and Bwog has analyzed Armstrong’s emails to determine whether they are AI-generated. Critical analyses like these are an important check against the administrative bureaucracy, but I think we’ve still missed an even bigger question: Does anyone know the actual message of those emails? I decided to take a quantitative approach to this question.

I compiled every protest-related email from Shafik and Armstrong and ran two analyses. The first was the Flesch-Kincaid readability test, which measures how difficult a text is to read. It generates two main scores: the Flesch Reading Ease score and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. The Reading Ease score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating easier readability (e.g., scores above 60 are easily understood by most people, while scores below 30 are considered difficult). The Grade Level score translates this into a U.S. school grade level—for example, a score of 12.0 means the text is expected to be understandable by a 12th grader. Both scores are calculated using a formula based on the average sentence length (total words divided by total sentences) and the average number of syllables per word. In short, longer sentences and more complex words = harder to read. 

The second was Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a machine learning method that identifies themes in a collection of documents. It assumes each document is comprised of a mixture of topics, and it figures out what those topics are by observing patterns in word usage and frequency. 

In simple terms, it’s like listening in on dozens of conversations and figuring out what people are talking about, not by what they say outright, but by which words tend to appear together. 

While it’s suspicious how similarly graded Shafik’s and Armstrong’s emails are to each other, remember that they are bred from the same cloth: both have extensive academic backgrounds, so it’s no surprise that their writing styles mirror the complexity and density of a research paper. 

This serves as a reminder–especially for us Ivy Leaguers–that complexity does not always improve a piece of writing. With an average Reading Ease score of 34.6 and Grade Level score of 14.3, these emails are rated as “difficult” to read and considered written at the “college level.” Yes, we go to Columbia, but mass emails to the school addressing urgent campus issues do not need to be written like a dissertation. For context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that the readability of public-facing texts “should not exceed 7th to 8th grade (average),”  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Clear Writing Hub website states “The more words you use, the longer your sentences, the more pages you write, the less likely your reader will understand or stick with you.” 

I’m not asking our next president to write at a 7th-grade level. But with sentences averaging over 23 words, these emails read like they were composed by a committee of legal professionals who sent them to be reviewed by a PR team that forgot students are the target audience. It’s not so much communication as linguistic liability management. 

The LDA model reveals a split in administrative focus. Shafik emphasized student activism, harassment, speech, and protest slightly more than Armstrong, which is understandable, given the encampments and spike in antisemitic incidents on campus following the October 7 Hamas attacks. On the other hand, it seems that Armstrong made a concerted effort to prioritize Columbia’s values, no doubt in response to the events of last year and the Trump administration’s scrutiny of the University. Both presidents wrote about campus safety at length, taking up over 40% of each president’s communications. 

The only statistically significant difference between the amounts that Armstrong and Shafik wrote about a certain topic is Topic 2, suggesting that Armstrong deliberately centered her messaging around Columbia’s mission and core values compared to Shafik. 

In context, this divergence makes sense, as each president faced a different set of problems throughout their term. But the important question isn’t about what Shafik and Armstrong focused on in their communications. It’s about what they did. Despite their rhetorical differences, both leaders followed the same pattern: say the right things, yet effect little change. 

What happened to the Task Force on Antisemitism? To date, they have only produced two reports, the last one published on August 30, 2024. And why did Armstrong publicly agree to enforce the federal mandate banning masks at protests while privately telling faculty that she would not uphold this policy? The administration’s hypocrisy would’ve surfaced at some point. Then there’s the President’s Advisory Committee on Institutional Voice. Armstrong announced the creation of this committee on September 17, 2024, but would not provide another update until five months later, only to tell us, “The Committee anticipates completing its work and providing a report to me by the end of the current academic year.” Imagine creating a committee to help you do your job, only to be ousted before they’ve done anything. Ouch. 

All this to say, these blunders aren’t just political mistakes. They reveal a deeper pattern of performative leadership, where stated commitments are routinely undermined by a lack of tangible results. And that’s the core issue.  Despite using the words “principle(s)” and “value(s)” a combined 73 times across 45 emails, Shafik and Armstrong did not act upon the principles and values that guide this institution; they only wrote about them.

Sure, the listening tables, fireside chats with administrators, and other university programming efforts may have been helpful. But in an institution as bureaucratic and slow-moving as Columbia, these efforts are rendered ineffective if the basics of leadership–like clear, timely communication and following through with commitments–aren’t practiced. 

I recognize that it is incredibly easy for me to sit here and critique Shafik and Armstrong when I have very little idea what they were dealing with behind closed doors. It’s a tough job, and no president will ever succeed in pleasing everyone. But maybe that’s the answer. Columbia needs a president who understands that they will not be able to make everyone happy. It may be prudent for the Board of Directors to find a candidate less entrenched in academia, as we need someone who has experience making high-stakes, tough decisions. Most importantly, though, we need a president who knows how to communicate effectively. If they can’t even exercise that basic skill, there’s no way they’re going to be able to lead Columbia.
